<h1 align="center">Wine Quality Prediction</h1>

This repository contains a machine learning project for predicting the quality of Wine using the dataset with 11 features. A Web App is built where you can input some feature values and get the wine quality prediction.

## About the Dataset


 The Dataset is available on : 

                       https://github.com/DivyanshKushwaha/datasets/blob/master/winequality-data.zip)

This dataset have 11 features :
  - fixed acidity
  - volatile acidity
  - citric acid
  - residual sugar
  - chlorides
  - free sulfur
  - dioxide
  - total sulfur dioxide
  - density
  - pH
  - sulphates
  - alcohol

## Model Used

- ElasticNet Regression model.




## Project Structure
This project is organized as follows:

- #### .gitignore
  This file specifies which files and directories should be ignored by Git.
- #### artifacts
     This folder contains the train,test and raw csv files along with the preprocessed and best model pickle file. These files are in this folder:
    - data_ingestion.py
    - data_transformation.py
    - data_validation.py
    - model_evaluation.py
    - model_trainer.py
- #### config
    This folder contains the artifacts files parameters like root directory, file path where the data is to be stored.
- #### logs
    This directory contains log files generated by the project.
- #### research
    This folder contains the .ipynb file of artifacts folder files. The coding of Data Ingestion to Model Training is done in this directory.
- #### src
    - This directory contains the source code for the project. The envoirement 'projectml' , created by the conda is stored here by the given command:
  
               conda create -n projectml python==3.9.18

  
    - Under the directory 'projectml' , there are subdirectories :
        - components : Source coding of artifacts files is done here. Many classes are created here like logging status , downloading , unzipping etc.
        - config : All config classes are created here.
        - constants : Constants like config_file_path, parameter_file_path are created here that we can use anywhere in the envoirement.
        - entity : All dataclasses of config.yaml are created here.
        - pipeline : The whole pipeline of this project is created here. From data ingestion to predicting the data , all tasks conding is done in this folder.
        - utils : Logging connection is stablished here.

logger.py: This file helps us to record and manage application events and information, facilitating debugging and monitoring.
utils.py: Contains utility functions used throughout the project.


templates : This folder contains the HTML files used for obtaining user input via form and flask uses these files as a rendering template.

#### Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
git clone https://github.com/rachitdani/Breast-Cancer-Prediction.git
Navigate to the project directory:
cd Breast-Cancer-Prediction
Install the required dependencies using pip:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Flask application:
python application.py
Open your web browser and go to
http://127.0.0.1:5001/ - to access the home page

http://127.0.0.1:5001/predict - to perform prediction on the Breast Cancer Prediction web application.

Usage
Once you have the web application running, you can use it to predict the occurence of breast cancer based on the input features. Simply provide the required information, and the application will provide you with the prediction.

Additionally, you can explore the Jupyter notebooks named EDA and Model Training in the notebooks directory to understand the data analysis and model development process.
